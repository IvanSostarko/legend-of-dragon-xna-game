# Legend of Dragon 

An old game I made in 2010 for National competition in informatics - Infokup (Croatia). This is a 3D game using Microsoft XNA 3.0 and C# .NET 2.0.

## Game Scope
The game is set in the 17th century during the reign of the noble family Zrinski in Cakovec (Medimurje). The aspiration is to educate about the history of Međimurje, old town Čakovec and family Zrinski. Using imagination we have created a picture of life in the old town Čakovec in that era. The topic of the Game is the old legend of the dragon Cakovec Pozoj who lived below the old town. His tail is beneath the walls of the Old City, while his head is below the church, st. Nicholas / center of today's Čakovec . We have made some identical objects that represent the reality of past and present. The objective is to learn as much as possible of the historical content about Medjimurje, the old town Čakovac and family Zrinski in order to progress through the game and ultimately answer the final question which is located in the castle Zrinski. The correct answer to the question will enable the final short film about the dragon. Game is designed in the spirit of Baroque and we have made models of houses, castles, churches and famous summer house Zrinski. Additional facilities for learning, can be found on the official game page, so you can try to solve the quiz page. We highly recommend this game because we are sure you will find it both interesting and rewarding.
